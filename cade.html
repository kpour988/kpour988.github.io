        The Cade Museum invited me to commemorate a celebration of the work of the neurosurgeon Albert Rhoton, Jr. with some conceptual graphics. They wanted to install lightboxes with abstract imagery that shows the connection between neuroscience and computer engineering. These lightboxes would hold fabric banners to diffuse the light.
    </p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy">I created 5 distinct sets of sequential imagery that blends from organic to synthetic forms of information transfer. This is meant to illustrate how advances in neuroscience are linked to computers and our interconnected technologies.</p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy">Five themes, 10 banners. Five of these were designed by me, and five are enlarged brain scans by doctor Gerry Shaw from the UF neurology department. These works are paired here for visual context.</p>
